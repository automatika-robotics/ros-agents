class CortexConfig(LLMConfig):
    """
    Configuration for the Cortex task planning and execution component.

    The Cortex component uses an LLM to decompose high-level tasks into sub-tasks
    and executes them by dispatching Actions registered on other components.

    The task execution follows a two-phase approach:

    1. **Planning** — A multi-step conversational loop where the LLM can call
       ``inspect_component`` to research available components and their capabilities.
       Once the LLM has enough context, it returns action tool calls which become
       the execution plan. RAG context from a vector DB is also available during
       this phase. Controlled by ``max_planning_steps``.
    2. **Execution** — Each planned step is executed sequentially. Before each
       step, a brief LLM confirmation call decides: EXECUTE, SKIP, or ABORT,
       based on the original plan and results so far. After a plan is fully
       executed, Cortex feeds the results back to the planner and may produce
       a follow-up plan, repeating the plan-execute loop until the planner
       signals completion. Both the per-plan length and the number of
       plan-execute iterations are capped by ``max_execution_steps``.

    The ``chat_history`` and ``stream`` fields are enforced by the component
    (``chat_history=True``, ``stream=False``) and cannot be overridden.

    :param max_planning_steps: Maximum number of LLM calls allowed during the
        planning phase (e.g. inspect_component calls). Default is 10.
    :type max_planning_steps: int
    :param max_execution_steps: Caps two things at once: (1) the maximum
        number of action steps allowed in any single execution plan, plans
        with more steps are truncated; and (2) the maximum number of
        plan-execute iterations Cortex will run before giving up if the
        planner never signals completion. The worst-case total number of
        actions executed for one task is therefore ``max_execution_steps²``.
        Default is 10.
    :type max_execution_steps: int
    :param confirmation_temperature: Temperature for the per-step confirmation LLM
        calls. Used for both the decision and resolving tool call arguments
        from prior step results. Default is 0.3.
    :type confirmation_temperature: float
    :param confirmation_max_tokens: Maximum tokens for confirmation responses.
        Must be large enough to accommodate a tool call with resolved arguments
        when the LLM returns EXECUTE. Default is 500.

        Default is 0.8 and must be greater than 0.0.

    :param input_timeout: The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for all required inputs

    :type input_timeout: float
    :param robot_urdf_file: Path to the robot's URDF file. This is strongly recommended
        for safety, as it allows the component to read joint limits and cap generated
        actions within safe bounds.
    :type robot_urdf_file: Optional[str]
    :param joint_limits: A manual dictionary of joint limits to be used if a URDF file
        is not provided. Format should match parsed URDF limits. When a URDF file is
        also provided, entries in this dictionary override the URDF-derived limits for
        those joints.
    :type joint_limits: Optional[Dict]
    :param policy_action_units: The unit space of the policy's actions, used to
        convert URDF-derived joint limits before capping. URDF `<limit>` values are
        always radians (per the URDF spec); this option converts them into the unit
        space of the policy's actions:
        - `"radians"` (default) — use URDF values as-is. Correct only when the policy
          outputs radians.
        - `"degrees"` — convert lower/upper (and velocity) to degrees.
        - `"normalized"` — the LeRobot SO-10x motor-unit convention: each joint's
          [lower, upper] range is mapped to [-100, 100]; joints whose name contains
          "gripper" or "jaw" are mapped to [0, 100]. Use this for policies trained on
          LeRobot datasets with normalized motor positions.
        Only applies to URDF-derived limits; the manual `joint_limits` dict is always
        used verbatim.
    :type policy_action_units: Literal["radians", "degrees", "normalized"]
    :param aggregate_fn_name: The strategy used to merge actions when newly received
        action chunks overlap timesteps already in the queue (chunks from consecutive
        inferences overlap). Presets mirror the LeRobot client:
        "latest_only" (new action wins), "weighted_average" (0.3 * old + 0.7 * new),
        "average" (0.5 * old + 0.5 * new) and "conservative" (0.7 * old + 0.3 * new).
        A custom callable set with `set_aggregation_function` on the component takes
        precedence over this preset. Default is "latest_only".
    :type aggregate_fn_name: Literal["latest_only", "weighted_average", "average", "conservative"]

    Configuration for the MoveIt manipulation component.

    It defines which planning groups to command on a running MoveIt 2 `move_group`
    node, how to plan (planner selection, effort, tolerances) and how the gripper
    is controlled.

    :param arm_group_name: Name of the SRDF planning group of the arm (e.g. "panda_arm"). Group names are defined in the robot's MoveIt (SRDF) configuration.
    :type arm_group_name: str
    :param gripper_group_name: Name of the SRDF planning group of the gripper (e.g. "hand"). Required for gripper control when `gripper_mode` is "move_group". Default is None.
    :type gripper_group_name: Optional[str]
    :param cartesian_group_name: Planning group used for Cartesian path requests (straight-line motions, including the descend/retreat steps of pick and place). Default is None, which uses `arm_group_name`. Setting a separate group lets an underactuated (e.g. 5-DOF) arm pair a position-only IK configuration on the arm group (for pose goals) with an orientation-tracking IK configuration on a twin group over the same chain. MoveIt's Cartesian interpolator validates the achieved orientation of every step against a fixed precision the request cannot override, which a position-only solver cannot meet.
    :type cartesian_group_name: Optional[str]
    :param oriented_group_name: Planning group for pose goals that carry an explicit orientation. Sampling orientation-constrained goals and tracking Cartesian interpolation steps place opposite demands on an IK solver, so underactuated arms may need a third IK profile here. Default is None, which falls back to `cartesian_group_name`, then `arm_group_name`.
    :type oriented_group_name: Optional[str]
    :param oriented_orientation_tolerance: Orientation tolerance in radians for pose goals that carry an explicit orientation. Kept tight because wrist slack moves the gripper jaws centimeters, while `goal_orientation_tolerance` stays wide for unoriented goals. Default is 0.15.
    :type oriented_orientation_tolerance: float
    :param grasp_orientation: End-effector attitude for pick goals without an orientation of their own, as a quaternion [x, y, z, w] in the pose reference frame. Derive it from a known-good grasp (e.g. FK over a demonstration pose). With approach_mode "side" it describes a grasp along +x and is rotated to the target's bearing, so one calibration serves every direction. Default is None (goals keep their own orientation, given or not).
    :type grasp_orientation: Optional[List[float]]
    :param end_effector_link: End-effector link that pose targets and Cartesian waypoints refer to. Empty (default) uses the planning group's default tip link.
    :type end_effector_link: str
    :param pose_reference_frame: Default reference frame for pose targets that carry an empty `header.frame_id`. Empty (default) uses move_group's planning frame.
    :type pose_reference_frame: str
    :param planning_pipeline: Planning pipeline to use (e.g. "ompl", "pilz_industrial_motion_planner"). Empty (default) uses move_group's default pipeline. Validated against the pipelines advertised by move_group at activation.
    :type planning_pipeline: str
    :param planner_id: Planner algorithm within the pipeline (e.g. "RRTConnect", "RRTstar" for OMPL). Empty (default) uses the pipeline's default planner. Validated against the planners advertised by move_group at activation.
    :type planner_id: str
    :param num_planning_attempts: Number of planning attempts before the best solution is returned. Default is 5.

    :param allowed_planning_time: Maximum planning time in seconds. Default is 5.0.
    :type allowed_planning_time: float
    :param max_velocity_scaling: Fraction of the joint velocity limits used when timing trajectories, in (0, 1]. Default is 0.1 — deliberately slow; increase once a setup is trusted.
    :type max_velocity_scaling: float
    :param max_acceleration_scaling: Fraction of the joint acceleration limits used when timing trajectories, in (0, 1]. Default is 0.1.
    :type max_acceleration_scaling: float
    :param goal_position_tolerance: Position tolerance in meters for pose targets. Default is 1e-3.
    :type goal_position_tolerance: float
    :param goal_orientation_tolerance: Orientation tolerance in radians for pose targets — a single value applied to all axes, or a list of 3 per-axis values (x, y, z). Relaxing a single axis (e.g. z to ~3.14) makes many poses reachable for underactuated (e.g. 5-DOF) arms. Default is 1e-2.
    :type goal_orientation_tolerance: Union[float, List[float]]
    :param goal_joint_tolerance: Position tolerance in radians for joint targets. Default is 1e-3.
    :type goal_joint_tolerance: float

    :type cartesian_max_step: float
    :param cartesian_jump_threshold: Maximum allowed joint-space jump between consecutive Cartesian points (0.0 disables the check). Default is 0.0.
    :type cartesian_jump_threshold: float

    :type cartesian_fraction_threshold: float
    :param gripper_mode: How the gripper is controlled: "move_group" (default) sends named targets on `gripper_group_name`; "gripper_command" sends a control_msgs GripperCommand to `gripper_command_action`.
    :type gripper_mode: Literal["move_group", "gripper_command"]

    :type gripper_close_target: str
    :param gripper_open_position: Gripper position used by `open_gripper` in "gripper_command" mode. Default is 0.04.
    :type gripper_open_position: float
    :param gripper_close_position: Gripper position used by `close_gripper` in "gripper_command" mode. Default is 0.0.
    :type gripper_close_position: float
    :param gripper_max_effort: Maximum effort for GripperCommand goals (0.0 lets the controller decide). Default is 0.0.
    :type gripper_max_effort: float
    :param move_group_namespace: Namespace prefix of the move_group interfaces (e.g. "/my_robot" if the actions are at "/my_robot/move_action"). Default is "".
    :type move_group_namespace: str
    :param move_group_node_name: Name of the move_group node, used to fetch the SRDF (named targets) from its parameters. Default is "move_group".
    :type move_group_node_name: str
    :param srdf_file: Path or URL of a local SRDF file used as fallback for named targets when the SRDF cannot be fetched from move_group. Default is None.
    :type srdf_file: Optional[str]
    :param server_timeout: Time in seconds to wait for move_group's servers to become available. Default is 30.0.
    :type server_timeout: float
    :param execution_timeout: Maximum wall time in seconds for a single plan+execute goal. Default is 120.0.
    :type execution_timeout: float
    :param scene_update_mode: WHEN detected objects are pushed into the planning scene: "manual" (default) only on the `update_planning_scene` component action, "on_goal" additionally refreshes the scene right before each motion goal is planned, "continuous" keeps refreshing at `scene_update_rate` while detections arrive. Only effective when the component is given a Detections3D input topic. In every mode the scene freezes while an object is held. The first refresh after release reconciles the scene.
    :type scene_update_mode: Literal["manual", "on_goal", "continuous"]
    :param scene_update_rate: Scene refreshes per second in "continuous" mode. Default is 1.0.
    :type scene_update_rate: float
    :param scene_detection_labels: Detection labels allowed into the planning scene. Default is None, which admits every label.
    :type scene_detection_labels: Optional[List[str]]
    :param scene_object_ttl: Seconds a detection-sourced object stays in the scene after the detector stops reporting it, before a refresh removes it. Bridges detection dropouts without keeping ghost obstacles around. Default is 5.0.
    :type scene_object_ttl: float
    :param object_padding: Margin in meters added on every side of detected objects, for planning clearance around imperfectly measured geometry. Default is 0.0.
    :type object_padding: float
    :param min_object_thickness: Floor in meters for each extent of a detected object. Surfaces seen head-on are lifted with no measurable extent along the view axis, and a zero-thickness box is invisible to collision checking. Default is 0.01.
    :type min_object_thickness: float
    :param touch_links: Links allowed to stay in contact with an attached object, e.g. the gripper's links. Default is None, which resolves them from the robot SRDF at attach time.
    :type touch_links: Optional[List[str]]
    :param approach_clearance: Height in meters above a pick or place target at which the collision-aware approach motion ends and the straight-line descent begins; also the height objects are lifted or retreated to. Default is 0.1.
    :type approach_clearance: float
    :param approach_mode: Geometry of the pick approach. "above" (default) hovers over the target and descends vertically, correct for grippers that can point down at their grasp. "side" puts the pre-grasp BEHIND the target at grasp height, backed off horizontally along the base-to-target bearing, so the straight-line descent becomes a horizontal slide into the grasp and the lift goes straight up instead of back to the pre-grasp point. For grippers whose mouths must take the object horizontally, such as surface-height grasps on underactuated arms.
    :type approach_mode: Literal["above", "side"]
    :param target_match_radius: How far in meters a scene object may be from a pick goal's target_pose and still be taken as the intended target. Tighten for dense scenes, loosen for coarse target coordinates such as language-model guesses. Default is 0.2.
