"""Turn 2D detections into metric 3D boxes given a depth image registered to the
frame the detections were made in and the camera's intrinsics or a point cloud from
a LiDAR or a stereo camera.

The geometry itself is done by kompass-core's depth detector, which takes the
median of the depth pixels or points inside a box, keeps them within a median
absolute deviation of it, and derives the object's extents from those. It is an
optional dependency.

Being a median, the reported distance is that of whatever fills most of the
box, so detections should be tight around their objects. Boxes come back in the
frame the camera's pose was given in, or in the camera's own optical frame when no
pose is given.
